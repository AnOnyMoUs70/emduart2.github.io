# Seven Lectures in Algebraic Statistics

The goal of the Seven Lectures in Algebraic Statistics is to give a practical introduction to several topics in Algebraic Statistics. No previous knowledge of statistics will be assumed. Familiarity with algebra at the level of Cox, Little, O’Shea’s book “Ideals, varieties, and algorithms” is a plus. The lecture will be 60 minutes long and be followed by a 30 minute practical session in R or Macaulay2.

## 21.10.2019 - Lecture 1  - Introduction
Key words: Parametric statistical model, exponential families, toric varieties. [R code.]({{ site.url }}/assets/SevenLectures2019/introToR.R) [Macaulay2 code.]({{ site.url }}/assets/SevenLectures2019/introToM2.m2)

and connections to toric varieties.--->
