# Seven Lectures in Algebraic Statistics

The goal of the Seven Lectures in Algebraic Statistics is to give a practical introduction to several topics in Algebraic Statistics. No previous knowledge of statistics will be assumed. Familiarity with algebra at the level of Cox, Little, O’Shea’s book “Ideals, varieties, and algorithms” is a plus. The lecture will be 60 minutes long and be followed by a 30 minute practical session in R or Macaulay2.

## Lecture 1 - Introduction
<!---Introduction to basic topics in probability and statistics. Examples of parametric statistical models
and connections to toric varieties.--->

## Lecture 2 - Fisher's exact test for discrete exponential families
<!---We discuss how to perform Fisher's exact test and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithms for sampling
for discrete exponential families. --->

## Lecture 3 - Conditional independence models
<!--- Definition of conditional independence models and connections to primary decomposition. --->

## Lecture 4 - Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Geometry
<!---Study maximum likelihood estimation with an algebraic geometric approach. --->

## Lecture 5 - Graphical Models
<!--- TBA --->

## Lecture 6 - Causality I


## Lecture 7 - Causality II
